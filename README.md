## Expo CLI Error: SDK Version Mismatch

This document describes a common error encountered when using the Expo CLI, specifically a mismatch between the SDK version specified in your app's `app.json` and the version supported by the Expo Go app. This often results in build or start failures.

**Possible Causes:**

* **Outdated Expo Go:** Your Expo Go app may not support the SDK version defined in your `app.json`.
* **Incorrect SDK Version in `app.json`:** Double-check that the SDK version in your `app.json` is compatible with your Expo Go app.
* **Dependency Conflicts:** Conflicting dependencies in your project can sometimes trigger this error.
* **Corrupted Project:** In rare cases, a corrupted project setup might be the root cause.

**Solutions:**

1. **Update Expo Go:** Ensure you're using the latest version of the Expo Go app from the app stores.  Older versions may have limited SDK compatibility.
2. **Update SDK Version in `app.json`:**  Adjust the `sdkVersion` in your `app.json` to a version that's compatible with your Expo Go app (check the Expo documentation for compatible SDK versions). 
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning your project's cache and rebuilding it. You can usually do this by deleting the `node_modules` folder and then running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. **Check Dependencies:** Inspect your `package.json` for any dependency conflicts that could potentially cause issues.  Try running `npm dedupe` or `yarn dedupe` to flatten your dependency tree.
5. **Create a New Project:** As a last resort, try creating a fresh Expo project to rule out any corruption in your current project.
