This error typically arises when there's a mismatch between the Expo Go app version on your device and the SDK version specified in your app's `app.json` file.  Expo Go has a specific range of SDK versions it supports; if your app's SDK version is outside this range, the error occurs.  Another cause could be an issue with your project's dependencies or a corrupted project setup.
