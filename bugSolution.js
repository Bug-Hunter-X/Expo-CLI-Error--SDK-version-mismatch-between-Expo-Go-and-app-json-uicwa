To resolve the SDK version mismatch, first update your Expo Go app to the latest version. Next, check your `app.json` file to ensure the `sdkVersion` aligns with compatible versions listed in Expo's documentation.  If necessary, adjust this version number. After changing the SDK version, clean your project by removing the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`. Then, try running the app again.

```javascript
// app.json (Example - adjust SDK version as needed)
{
  "expo": {
    "sdkVersion": "48.0.0",
    // ... other settings
  }
}
```

If problems persist, consider checking for dependency conflicts in your `package.json` file or creating a new Expo project to eliminate possible corruption.
